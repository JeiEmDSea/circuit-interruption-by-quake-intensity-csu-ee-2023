# Intensity-based Earthquake Detector with Automatic Circuit Interrupter

The general purpose of this study is to develop an Arduino-based earthquake detection with automatic circuit breaker interruption.

Specifically, the study aims to achieve the following:
1. To develop a sensitivity curve.
2. To test the device reliability and accuracy of the device.
  The systemâ€™s completion will demonstrate that utilizing microprocessor, sensors, and earthquake detection can interrupt circuit breakers.
